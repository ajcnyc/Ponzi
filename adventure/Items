A Dollar
Home
The United States dollar (sign: $; code: USD; also abbreviated US$ and referred
to as the dollar, U.S. dollar, or American dollar) is the official currency of
the United States and its territories per the United States Constitution since
1792. In practice, the dollar is divided into 100 smaller cent (¢) units, but
is occasionally divided into 1000 mills (₥) for accounting. The circulating
paper money consists of Federal Reserve Notes that are denominated in United
States dollars (12 U.S.C. § 418).
Since the suspension in 1971[9] of convertibility of paper U.S. currency into
any precious metal, the U.S. dollar is, de facto, fiat money.[10] As it is the
most used in international transactions, the U.S. dollar is the world's primary
reserve currency.[11] Several countries use it as their official currency, and
in many others it is the de facto currency.[12] Besides the United States, it is
also used as the sole currency in two British Overseas Territories in the
Caribbean: the British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands. A few
countries use the Federal Reserve Notes for paper money, while still minting
their own coins, or also accept U.S. dollar coins (such as the Sacagawea or
presidential dollar). As of June 27, 2018, there are approximately $1.67
trillion in circulation, of which $1.62 trillion is in Federal Reserve notes
(the remaining $50 billion is in the form of coins).[13] -Wikipedia
